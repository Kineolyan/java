## Hints

The simulated context of this exercise is an application receiving two inputs:

 - the new words to guess from some game engine,
 - the letters inputed by the player.

The class `Output` is the expected result of the exercise processing, allowing a front-end to
display the complete state of the game without requiring from it any form of storage - thus making
it functional as well.
